# Password-please
A local password saving/editing programm.

It needs more work with database encryption, but it does the job for the average joe.
I suggest saving the file with its database on the cloud so you can access your passwords anywhere.

It needs code optimization and commenting, also it may have some bugs so any help is welcome...
